The candidate needs to have statistical, mathematical, predictive modelling as well as business strategy skills. They also need to be able to build the algorithms necessary, to ask the right questions and find the right answers. They need to be able to communicate their findings, both verbally and visually to senior audiences. They need to understand how the products are developed and even more important, as big data touches the privacy of consumers, they need to have a set of ethical responsibilities. They need to be self-starters, able to proactively identify the problems that need solving.  They need to be very curious people, who enjoy diving deep into the material to find an answer to a yet unknown question. They need to have a natural desire to go beneath the surface of a problem. They need to be thinkers who can ask the right (business) questions. They need to be confident and self-secure as they more often than not will have to deal with situations where there is a lot unknown. They need to be patient as finding the unknown in massive data sets will take a lot of time and developing the algorithm to uncover new insights will often be trial-and-error.  A data scientist understands how to integrate multiple systems and data sets. They need to be able to link and mash up distinctive data sets to discover new insights. This often requires connecting different types of data sets in different forms as well as being able to work with potentially incomplete data sources and cleaning data sets to be able to use them.Requirements Typically the background is a Masterís Degree or even PhD in Mathematics, Statistics or Operational Research, coupled with several years of appropriate experience in data analyticsResponsibilitiesBasic Tools: This means an expertise in the database querying language SQL AND a  statistical programming language, like R or Python. Basic Statistics: An understanding of statistics is vital as a data scientist. They should be familiar with statistical tests, distributions, etc. One of the more important aspects of the role is understanding when different techniques are (or arenít) a valid approach. Statistics is important at all company types, but especially data-driven companies where the product is not data-focused and product stakeholders will depend on your help to make decisions and design / evaluate experiments.  Machine Learning : A need to be familiar with machine learning methods. This can mean things like k-nearest neighbours, random forests, ensemble methods ñ other machine learning techniques. Itís not necessarily a deal breaker if youíre not the worldís leading expert on how the algorithms work. It is more important is to understand the broad strokes and really understand when it is appropriate to use different techniques.  Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra: A data scientist will be expected to build out their own implementations in house. Understanding these concepts of mv is most important at companies where the product is defined by the data and small improvements in predictive performance or algorithm optimization can lead to huge wins for the company. Data Munging: Often the data youíre analysing is going to be messy and difficult to work with. Because of this, itís really important to know how to deal with imperfections in data. Some examples of data imperfections include missing values, inconsistent string formatting (e.g., ëCentral Londoní versus ëLondoní versus ëEC1í), and date formatting (ë2014-01-01í vs. ë01/01/2014í, , etc.). Data Visualization & Communication: Visualizing and communicating data is incredibly important; we are viewed as people who help others make data-driven decisions. When it comes to communicating, this means describing your findings or the way techniques work to audiences, both technical and non-technical. Visualization wise, it can be immensely helpful to be familiar with data visualization tools like ìtableauî. It is important to not just be familiar with the tools necessary to visualize data, also the principles behind visually encoding data and communicating information. Presentation: The data scientist needs to be able to summarise data to suit the end audience, focussing on recommendations and actionable insight generated from their analysis.

This often requires connecting different types of data sets in different forms as well as being able to work with potentially incomplete data sources and cleaning data sets to be able to use them.Requirements Typically the background is a Masterís Degree or even PhD in Mathematics, Statistics or Operational Research, coupled with several years of appropriate experience in data analyticsResponsibilitiesBasic Tools: This means an expertise in the database querying language SQL AND a  statistical programming language, like R or Python. Basic Statistics: An understanding of statistics is vital as a data scientist. They should be familiar with statistical tests, distributions, etc. One of the more important aspects of the role is understanding when different techniques are (or arenít) a valid approach. Statistics is important at all company types, but especially data-driven companies where the product is not data-focused and product stakeholders will depend on your help to make decisions and design / evaluate experiments.  Machine Learning : A need to be familiar with machine learning methods. This can mean things like k-nearest neighbours, random forests, ensemble methods ñ other machine learning techniques. Itís not necessarily a deal breaker if youíre not the worldís leading expert on how the algorithms work. It is more important is to understand the broad strokes and really understand when it is appropriate to use different techniques.  Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra: A data scientist will be expected to build out their own implementations in house. Understanding these concepts of mv is most important at companies where the product is defined by the data and small improvements in predictive performance or algorithm optimization can lead to huge wins for the company. Data Munging: Often the data youíre analysing is going to be messy and difficult to work with. Because of this, itís really important to know how to deal with imperfections in data. Some examples of data imperfections include missing values, inconsistent string formatting (e.g., ëCentral Londoní versus ëLondoní versus ëEC1í), and date formatting (ë2014-01-01í vs. ë01/01/2014í, , etc.). Data Visualization & Communication: Visualizing and communicating data is incredibly important; we are viewed as people who help others make data-driven decisions. When it comes to communicating, this means describing your findings or the way techniques work to audiences, both technical and non-technical. Visualization wise, it can be immensely helpful to be familiar with data visualization tools like ìtableauî. It is important to not just be familiar with the tools necessary to visualize data, also the principles behind visually encoding data and communicating information. Presentation: The data scientist needs to be able to summarise data to suit the end audience, focussing on recommendations and actionable insight generated from their analysis. They must be experienced at presenting data and findings in an articulate actionable way to all levels of audience. This should be demonstrated at an interview and is often the differentiating feature between an analyst programmer and a Data Scientist. Thinking Like A Data Scientist: We will want to see that youíre a (data-driven) problem solver ñ for example, about a test the company may want to run or a data-driven product it may want to develop. Itís important to think about what things are important, and what things arenít. How should you, as the data scientist, interact with the Marketing teams, IT, and product managers? What methods should you use? When do approximations make sense?The Individual The exact background of a data scientist is very important. Typically the background is a Masterís Degree or even PhD in Mathematics, Statistics or Operational Research, coupled with several years of appropriate experience in data analytics. A Data Scientist should have most of the following skills: Strong written and verbal communication skillsAbility to work in a fast-paced multidisciplinary environment as in a competitive landscape new data keeps flowing in rapidly and the world is constantly changingHave the ability to query databases and perform statistical analysis;Be able to develop or program databasesBe able to advise senior management in clear language about the implications of their work for the organisationHave understanding of how business and strategy worksBeing able to create examples, prototypes, demonstrations to help management better understand the workHaving a good understanding of design and architecture principlesBeing able to work autonomously In short, the big data scientist needs to have an understanding of almost everything analytically coupled with commercial acumen.Additional informationThere will be project work to complete, which should be done in a professional manner.The duties listed are not exhaustive.

The candidate needs to have statistical, mathematical, predictive modelling as well as business strategy skills. They also need to be able to build the algorithms necessary, to ask the right questions and find the right answers. They need to be able to communicate their findings, both verbally and visually to senior audiences. They need to understand how the products are developed and even more important, as big data touches the privacy of consumers, they need to have a set of ethical responsibilities. They need to be self-starters, able to proactively identify the problems that need solving.  They need to be very curious people, who enjoy diving deep into the material to find an answer to a yet unknown question. They need to have a natural desire to go beneath the surface of a problem. They need to be thinkers who can ask the right (business) questions. They need to be confident and self-secure as they more often than not will have to deal with situations where there is a lot unknown. They need to be patient as finding the unknown in massive data sets will take a lot of time and developing the algorithm to uncover new insights will often be trial-and-error.  A data scientist understands how to integrate multiple systems and data sets. They need to be able to link and mash up distinctive data sets to discover new insights. This often requires connecting different types of data sets in different forms as well as being able to work with potentially incomplete data sources and cleaning data sets to be able to use them.Requirements Typically the background is a Masterís Degree or even PhD in Mathematics, Statistics or Operational Research, coupled with several years of appropriate experience in data analyticsResponsibilitiesBasic Tools: This means an expertise in the database querying language SQL AND a  statistical programming language, like R or Python. Basic Statistics: An understanding of statistics is vital as a data scientist. They should be familiar with statistical tests, distributions, etc. One of the more important aspects of the role is understanding when different techniques are (or arenít) a valid approach. Statistics is important at all company types, but especially data-driven companies where the product is not data-focused and product stakeholders will depend on your help to make decisions and design / evaluate experiments.  Machine Learning : A need to be familiar with machine learning methods. This can mean things like k-nearest neighbours, random forests, ensemble methods ñ other machine learning techniques. Itís not necessarily a deal breaker if youíre not the worldís leading expert on how the algorithms work. It is more important is to understand the broad strokes and really understand when it is appropriate to use different techniques.  Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra: A data scientist will be expected to build out their own implementations in house. Understanding these concepts of mv is most important at companies where the product is defined by the data and small improvements in predictive performance or algorithm optimization can lead to huge wins for the company. Data Munging: Often the data youíre analysing is going to be messy and difficult to work with. Because of this, itís really important to know how to deal with imperfections in data. Some examples of data imperfections include missing values, inconsistent string formatting (e.g., ëCentral Londoní versus ëLondoní versus ëEC1í), and date formatting (ë2014-01-01í vs. ë01/01/2014í, , etc.). Data Visualization & Communication: Visualizing and communicating data is incredibly important; we are viewed as people who help others make data-driven decisions. When it comes to communicating, this means describing your findings or the way techniques work to audiences, both technical and non-technical. Visualization wise, it can be immensely helpful to be familiar with data visualization tools like ìtableauî. It is important to not just be familiar with the tools necessary to visualize data, also the principles behind visually encoding data and communicating information. Presentation: The data scientist needs to be able to summarise data to suit the end audience, focussing on recommendations and actionable insight generated from their analysis. They must be experienced at presenting data and findings in an articulate actionable way to all levels of audience. This should be demonstrated at an interview and is often the differentiating feature between an analyst programmer and a Data Scientist. Thinking Like A Data Scientist: We will want to see that youíre a (data-driven) problem solver ñ for example, about a test the company may want to run or a data-driven product it may want to develop. Itís important to think about what things are important, and what things arenít. How should you, as the data scientist, interact with the Marketing teams, IT, and product managers? What methods should you use? When do approximations make sense?The Individual The exact background of a data scientist is very important. Typically the background is a Masterís Degree or even PhD in Mathematics, Statistics or Operational Research, coupled with several years of appropriate experience in data analytics.

The candidate needs to have statistical, mathematical, predictive modelling as well as business strategy skills. They also need to be able to build the algorithms necessary, to ask the right questions and find the right answers. They need to be able to communicate their findings, both verbally and visually to senior audiences. They need to understand how the products are developed and even more important, as big data touches the privacy of consumers, they need to have a set of ethical responsibilities. They need to be self-starters, able to proactively identify the problems that need solving.  They need to be very curious people, who enjoy diving deep into the material to find an answer to a yet unknown question. They need to have a natural desire to go beneath the surface of a problem. They need to be thinkers who can ask the right (business) questions. They need to be confident and self-secure as they more often than not will have to deal with situations where there is a lot unknown. They need to be patient as finding the unknown in massive data sets will take a lot of time and developing the algorithm to uncover new insights will often be trial-and-error.  A data scientist understands how to integrate multiple systems and data sets. They need to be able to link and mash up distinctive data sets to discover new insights. This often requires connecting different types of data sets in different forms as well as being able to work with potentially incomplete data sources and cleaning data sets to be able to use them.Requirements Typically the background is a Masterís Degree or even PhD in Mathematics, Statistics or Operational Research, coupled with several years of appropriate experience in data analyticsResponsibilitiesBasic Tools: This means an expertise in the database querying language SQL AND a  statistical programming language, like R or Python. Basic Statistics: An understanding of statistics is vital as a data scientist. They should be familiar with statistical tests, distributions, etc. One of the more important aspects of the role is understanding when different techniques are (or arenít) a valid approach. Statistics is important at all company types, but especially data-driven companies where the product is not data-focused and product stakeholders will depend on your help to make decisions and design / evaluate experiments.  Machine Learning : A need to be familiar with machine learning methods. This can mean things like k-nearest neighbours, random forests, ensemble methods ñ other machine learning techniques. Itís not necessarily a deal breaker if youíre not the worldís leading expert on how the algorithms work. It is more important is to understand the broad strokes and really understand when it is appropriate to use different techniques.  Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra: A data scientist will be expected to build out their own implementations in house. Understanding these concepts of mv is most important at companies where the product is defined by the data and small improvements in predictive performance or algorithm optimization can lead to huge wins for the company. Data Munging: Often the data youíre analysing is going to be messy and difficult to work with. Because of this, itís really important to know how to deal with imperfections in data. Some examples of data imperfections include missing values, inconsistent string formatting (e.g., ëCentral Londoní versus ëLondoní versus ëEC1í), and date formatting (ë2014-01-01í vs. ë01/01/2014í, , etc.). Data Visualization & Communication: Visualizing and communicating data is incredibly important; we are viewed as people who help others make data-driven decisions. When it comes to communicating, this means describing your findings or the way techniques work to audiences, both technical and non-technical. Visualization wise, it can be immensely helpful to be familiar with data visualization tools like ìtableauî. It is important to not just be familiar with the tools necessary to visualize data, also the principles behind visually encoding data and communicating information. Presentation: The data scientist needs to be able to summarise data to suit the end audience, focussing on recommendations and actionable insight generated from their analysis. They must be experienced at presenting data and findings in an articulate actionable way to all levels of audience. This should be demonstrated at an interview and is often the differentiating feature between an analyst programmer and a Data Scientist. Thinking Like A Data Scientist: We will want to see that youíre a (data-driven) problem solver ñ for example, about a test the company may want to run or a data-driven product it may want to develop. Itís important to think about what things are important, and what things arenít. How should you, as the data scientist, interact with the Marketing teams, IT, and product managers? What methods should you use? When do approximations make sense?The Individual The exact background of a data scientist is very important. Typically the background is a Masterís Degree or even PhD in Mathematics, Statistics or Operational Research, coupled with several years of appropriate experience in data analytics. A Data Scientist should have most of the following skills: Strong written and verbal communication skillsAbility to work in a fast-paced multidisciplinary environment as in a competitive landscape new data keeps flowing in rapidly and the world is constantly changingHave the ability to query databases and perform statistical analysis;Be able to develop or program databasesBe able to advise senior management in clear language about the implications of their work for the organisationHave understanding of how business and strategy worksBeing able to create examples, prototypes, demonstrations to help management better understand the workHaving a good understanding of design and architecture principlesBeing able to work autonomously In short, the big data scientist needs to have an understanding of almost everything analytically coupled with commercial acumen.Additional informationThere will be project work to complete, which should be done in a professional manner.The duties listed are not exhaustive.

"205"," Saga Group"," †ñ†Folkestone, SC"," Data Scientist ReferenceSAG01746Job TitleData ScientistCompanySaga Group LtdLocationFolkestoneClosing Date30/08/2017 22:59Salary Up To£45,273 - £66,506Job Description Summary We are looking for an experienced Data Scientist. The candidate needs to have statistical, mathematical, predictive modelling as well as business strategy skills. They also need to be able to build the algorithms necessary, to ask the right questions and find the right answers. They need to be able to communicate their findings, both verbally and visually to senior audiences. They need to understand how the products are developed and even more important, as big data touches the privacy of consumers, they need to have a set of ethical responsibilities. They need to be self-starters, able to proactively identify the problems that need solving.  They need to be very curious people, who enjoy diving deep into the material to find an answer to a yet unknown question. They need to have a natural desire to go beneath the surface of a problem. They need to be thinkers who can ask the right (business) questions. They need to be confident and self-secure as they more often than not will have to deal with situations where there is a lot unknown. They need to be patient as finding the unknown in massive data sets will take a lot of time and developing the algorithm to uncover new insights will often be trial-and-error.  A data scientist understands how to integrate multiple systems and data sets. They need to be able to link and mash up distinctive data sets to discover new insights. This often requires connecting different types of data sets in different forms as well as being able to work with potentially incomplete data sources and cleaning data sets to be able to use them.Requirements Typically the background is a Masterís Degree or even PhD in Mathematics, Statistics or Operational Research, coupled with several years of appropriate experience in data analyticsResponsibilitiesBasic Tools: This means an expertise in the database querying language SQL AND a  statistical programming language, like R or Python. Basic Statistics: An understanding of statistics is vital as a data scientist. They should be familiar with statistical tests, distributions, etc. One of the more important aspects of the role is understanding when different techniques are (or arenít) a valid approach. Statistics is important at all company types, but especially data-driven companies where the product is not data-focused and product stakeholders will depend on your help to make decisions and design / evaluate experiments.  Machine Learning : A need to be familiar with machine learning methods. This can mean things like k-nearest neighbours, random forests, ensemble methods ñ other machine learning techniques. Itís not necessarily a deal breaker if youíre not the worldís leading expert on how the algorithms work. It is more important is to understand the broad strokes and really understand when it is appropriate to use different techniques.  Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra: A data scientist will be expected to build out their own implementations in house. Understanding these concepts of mv is most important at companies where the product is defined by the data and small improvements in predictive performance or algorithm optimization can lead to huge wins for the company. Data Munging: Often the data youíre analysing is going to be messy and difficult to work with. Because of this, itís really important to know how to deal with imperfections in data. Some examples of data imperfections include missing values, inconsistent string formatting (e.g., ëCentral Londoní versus ëLondoní versus ëEC1í), and date formatting (ë2014-01-01í vs. ë01/01/2014í, , etc.). Data Visualization & Communication: Visualizing and communicating data is incredibly important; we are viewed as people who help others make data-driven decisions. When it comes to communicating, this means describing your findings or the way techniques work to audiences, both technical and non-technical. Visualization wise, it can be immensely helpful to be familiar with data visualization tools like ìtableauî. It is important to not just be familiar with the tools necessary to visualize data, also the principles behind visually encoding data and communicating information. Presentation: The data scientist needs to be able to summarise data to suit the end audience, focussing on recommendations and actionable insight generated from their analysis. They must be experienced at presenting data and findings in an articulate actionable way to all levels of audience. This should be demonstrated at an interview and is often the differentiating feature between an analyst programmer and a Data Scientist. Thinking Like A Data Scientist: We will want to see that youíre a (data-driven) problem solver ñ for example, about a test the company may want to run or a data-driven product it may want to develop. Itís important to think about what things are important, and what things arenít. How should you, as the data scientist, interact with the Marketing teams, IT, and product managers? What methods should you use? When do approximations make sense?The Individual The exact background of a data scientist is very important. Typically the background is a Masterís Degree or even PhD in Mathematics, Statistics or Operational Research, coupled with several years of appropriate experience in data analytics. A Data Scientist should have most of the following skills: Strong written and verbal communication skillsAbility to work in a fast-paced multidisciplinary environment as in a competitive landscape new data keeps flowing in rapidly and the world is constantly changingHave the ability to query databases and perform statistical analysis;Be able to develop or program databasesBe able to advise senior management in clear language about the implications of their work for the organisationHave understanding of how business and strategy worksBeing able to create examples, prototypes, demonstrations to help management better understand the workHaving a good understanding of design and architecture principlesBeing able to work autonomously In short, the big data scientist needs to have an understanding of almost everything analytically coupled with commercial acumen.Additional informationThere will be project work to complete, which should be done in a professional manner.The duties listed are not exhaustive.

The candidate needs to have statistical, mathematical, predictive modelling as well as business strategy skills. They also need to be able to build the algorithms necessary, to ask the right questions and find the right answers. They need to be able to communicate their findings, both verbally and visually to senior audiences. They need to understand how the products are developed and even more important, as big data touches the privacy of consumers, they need to have a set of ethical responsibilities. They need to be self-starters, able to proactively identify the problems that need solving.  They need to be very curious people, who enjoy diving deep into the material to find an answer to a yet unknown question. They need to have a natural desire to go beneath the surface of a problem. They need to be thinkers who can ask the right (business) questions. They need to be confident and self-secure as they more often than not will have to deal with situations where there is a lot unknown. They need to be patient as finding the unknown in massive data sets will take a lot of time and developing the algorithm to uncover new insights will often be trial-and-error.  A data scientist understands how to integrate multiple systems and data sets. They need to be able to link and mash up distinctive data sets to discover new insights. This often requires connecting different types of data sets in different forms as well as being able to work with potentially incomplete data sources and cleaning data sets to be able to use them.Requirements Typically the background is a Masterís Degree or even PhD in Mathematics, Statistics or Operational Research, coupled with several years of appropriate experience in data analyticsResponsibilitiesBasic Tools: This means an expertise in the database querying language SQL AND a  statistical programming language, like R or Python. Basic Statistics: An understanding of statistics is vital as a data scientist. They should be familiar with statistical tests, distributions, etc. One of the more important aspects of the role is understanding when different techniques are (or arenít) a valid approach. Statistics is important at all company types, but especially data-driven companies where the product is not data-focused and product stakeholders will depend on your help to make decisions and design / evaluate experiments.  Machine Learning : A need to be familiar with machine learning methods. This can mean things like k-nearest neighbours, random forests, ensemble methods ñ other machine learning techniques. Itís not necessarily a deal breaker if youíre not the worldís leading expert on how the algorithms work. It is more important is to understand the broad strokes and really understand when it is appropriate to use different techniques.  Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra: A data scientist will be expected to build out their own implementations in house. Understanding these concepts of mv is most important at companies where the product is defined by the data and small improvements in predictive performance or algorithm optimization can lead to huge wins for the company. Data Munging: Often the data youíre analysing is going to be messy and difficult to work with. Because of this, itís really important to know how to deal with imperfections in data. Some examples of data imperfections include missing values, inconsistent string formatting (e.g., ëCentral Londoní versus ëLondoní versus ëEC1í), and date formatting (ë2014-01-01í vs. ë01/01/2014í, , etc.). Data Visualization & Communication: Visualizing and communicating data is incredibly important; we are viewed as people who help others make data-driven decisions. When it comes to communicating, this means describing your findings or the way techniques work to audiences, both technical and non-technical. Visualization wise, it can be immensely helpful to be familiar with data visualization tools like ìtableauî. It is important to not just be familiar with the tools necessary to visualize data, also the principles behind visually encoding data and communicating information. Presentation: The data scientist needs to be able to summarise data to suit the end audience, focussing on recommendations and actionable insight generated from their analysis. They must be experienced at presenting data and findings in an articulate actionable way to all levels of audience. This should be demonstrated at an interview and is often the differentiating feature between an analyst programmer and a Data Scientist. Thinking Like A Data Scientist: We will want to see that youíre a (data-driven) problem solver ñ for example, about a test the company may want to run or a data-driven product it may want to develop. Itís important to think about what things are important, and what things arenít. How should you, as the data scientist, interact with the Marketing teams, IT, and product managers? What methods should you use? When do approximations make sense?The Individual The exact background of a data scientist is very important. Typically the background is a Masterís Degree or even PhD in Mathematics, Statistics or Operational Research, coupled with several years of appropriate experience in data analytics. A Data Scientist should have most of the following skills: Strong written and verbal communication skillsAbility to work in a fast-paced multidisciplinary environment as in a competitive landscape new data keeps flowing in rapidly and the world is constantly changingHave the ability to query databases and perform statistical analysis;Be able to develop or program databasesBe able to advise senior management in clear language about the implications of their work for the organisationHave understanding of how business and strategy worksBeing able to create examples, prototypes, demonstrations to help management better understand the workHaving a good understanding of design and architecture principlesBeing able to work autonomously In short, the big data scientist needs to have an understanding of almost everything analytically coupled with commercial acumen.Additional informationThere will be project work to complete, which should be done in a professional manner.The duties listed are not exhaustive.

The candidate needs to have statistical, mathematical, predictive modelling as well as business strategy skills. They also need to be able to build the algorithms necessary, to ask the right questions and find the right answers. They need to be able to communicate their findings, both verbally and visually to senior audiences. They need to understand how the products are developed and even more important, as big data touches the privacy of consumers, they need to have a set of ethical responsibilities. They need to be self-starters, able to proactively identify the problems that need solving.  They need to be very curious people, who enjoy diving deep into the material to find an answer to a yet unknown question. They need to have a natural desire to go beneath the surface of a problem. They need to be thinkers who can ask the right (business) questions. They need to be confident and self-secure as they more often than not will have to deal with situations where there is a lot unknown. They need to be patient as finding the unknown in massive data sets will take a lot of time and developing the algorithm to uncover new insights will often be trial-and-error.  A data scientist understands how to integrate multiple systems and data sets. They need to be able to link and mash up distinctive data sets to discover new insights. This often requires connecting different types of data sets in different forms as well as being able to work with potentially incomplete data sources and cleaning data sets to be able to use them.Requirements Typically the background is a Masterís Degree or even PhD in Mathematics, Statistics or Operational Research, coupled with several years of appropriate experience in data analyticsResponsibilitiesBasic Tools: This means an expertise in the database querying language SQL AND a  statistical programming language, like R or Python. Basic Statistics: An understanding of statistics is vital as a data scientist. They should be familiar with statistical tests, distributions, etc. One of the more important aspects of the role is understanding when different techniques are (or arenít) a valid approach. Statistics is important at all company types, but especially data-driven companies where the product is not data-focused and product stakeholders will depend on your help to make decisions and design / evaluate experiments.  Machine Learning : A need to be familiar with machine learning methods. This can mean things like k-nearest neighbours, random forests, ensemble methods ñ other machine learning techniques. Itís not necessarily a deal breaker if youíre not the worldís leading expert on how the algorithms work. It is more important is to understand the broad strokes and really understand when it is appropriate to use different techniques.  Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra: A data scientist will be expected to build out their own implementations in house. Understanding these concepts of mv is most important at companies where the product is defined by the data and small improvements in predictive performance or algorithm optimization can lead to huge wins for the company. Data Munging: Often the data youíre analysing is going to be messy and difficult to work with. Because of this, itís really important to know how to deal with imperfections in data. Some examples of data imperfections include missing values, inconsistent string formatting (e.g., ëCentral Londoní versus ëLondoní versus ëEC1í), and date formatting (ë2014-01-01í vs. ë01/01/2014í, , etc.). Data Visualization & Communication: Visualizing and communicating data is incredibly important; we are viewed as people who help others make data-driven decisions. When it comes to communicating, this means describing your findings or the way techniques work to audiences, both technical and non-technical. Visualization wise, it can be immensely helpful to be familiar with data visualization tools like ìtableauî. It is important to not just be familiar with the tools necessary to visualize data, also the principles behind visually encoding data and communicating information. Presentation: The data scientist needs to be able to summarise data to suit the end audience, focussing on recommendations and actionable insight generated from their analysis. They must be experienced at presenting data and findings in an articulate actionable way to all levels of audience. This should be demonstrated at an interview and is often the differentiating feature between an analyst programmer and a Data Scientist. Thinking Like A Data Scientist: We will want to see that youíre a (data-driven) problem solver ñ for example, about a test the company may want to run or a data-driven product it may want to develop. Itís important to think about what things are important, and what things arenít. How should you, as the data scientist, interact with the Marketing teams, IT, and product managers? What methods should you use? When do approximations make sense?The Individual The exact background of a data scientist is very important. Typically the background is a Masterís Degree or even PhD in Mathematics, Statistics or Operational Research, coupled with several years of appropriate experience in data analytics. A Data Scientist should have most of the following skills: Strong written and verbal communication skillsAbility to work in a fast-paced multidisciplinary environment as in a competitive landscape new data keeps flowing in rapidly and the world is constantly changingHave the ability to query databases and perform statistical analysis;Be able to develop or program databasesBe able to advise senior management in clear language about the implications of their work for the organisationHave understanding of how business and strategy worksBeing able to create examples, prototypes, demonstrations to help management better understand the workHaving a good understanding of design and architecture principlesBeing able to work autonomously In short, the big data scientist needs to have an understanding of almost everything analytically coupled with commercial acumen.Additional informationThere will be project work to complete, which should be done in a professional manner.The duties listed are not exhaustive.

The candidate needs to have statistical, mathematical, predictive modelling as well as business strategy skills. They also need to be able to build the algorithms necessary, to ask the right questions and find the right answers. They need to be able to communicate their findings, both verbally and visually to senior audiences. They need to understand how the products are developed and even more important, as big data touches the privacy of consumers, they need to have a set of ethical responsibilities. They need to be self-starters, able to proactively identify the problems that need solving.  They need to be very curious people, who enjoy diving deep into the material to find an answer to a yet unknown question. They need to have a natural desire to go beneath the surface of a problem. They need to be thinkers who can ask the right (business) questions. They need to be confident and self-secure as they more often than not will have to deal with situations where there is a lot unknown. They need to be patient as finding the unknown in massive data sets will take a lot of time and developing the algorithm to uncover new insights will often be trial-and-error.  A data scientist understands how to integrate multiple systems and data sets. They need to be able to link and mash up distinctive data sets to discover new insights. This often requires connecting different types of data sets in different forms as well as being able to work with potentially incomplete data sources and cleaning data sets to be able to use them.Requirements Typically the background is a Masterís Degree or even PhD in Mathematics, Statistics or Operational Research, coupled with several years of appropriate experience in data analyticsResponsibilitiesBasic Tools: This means an expertise in the database querying language SQL AND a  statistical programming language, like R or Python. Basic Statistics: An understanding of statistics is vital as a data scientist. They should be familiar with statistical tests, distributions, etc. One of the more important aspects of the role is understanding when different techniques are (or arenít) a valid approach. Statistics is important at all company types, but especially data-driven companies where the product is not data-focused and product stakeholders will depend on your help to make decisions and design / evaluate experiments.  Machine Learning : A need to be familiar with machine learning methods. This can mean things like k-nearest neighbours, random forests, ensemble methods ñ other machine learning techniques. Itís not necessarily a deal breaker if youíre not the worldís leading expert on how the algorithms work. It is more important is to understand the broad strokes and really understand when it is appropriate to use different techniques.  Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra: A data scientist will be expected to build out their own implementations in house. Understanding these concepts of mv is most important at companies where the product is defined by the data and small improvements in predictive performance or algorithm optimization can lead to huge wins for the company. Data Munging: Often the data youíre analysing is going to be messy and difficult to work with. Because of this, itís really important to know how to deal with imperfections in data. Some examples of data imperfections include missing values, inconsistent string formatting (e.g., ëCentral Londoní versus ëLondoní versus ëEC1í), and date formatting (ë2014-01-01í vs. ë01/01/2014í, , etc.). Data Visualization & Communication: Visualizing and communicating data is incredibly important; we are viewed as people who help others make data-driven decisions. When it comes to communicating, this means describing your findings or the way techniques work to audiences, both technical and non-technical. Visualization wise, it can be immensely helpful to be familiar with data visualization tools like ìtableauî. It is important to not just be familiar with the tools necessary to visualize data, also the principles behind visually encoding data and communicating information. Presentation: The data scientist needs to be able to summarise data to suit the end audience, focussing on recommendations and actionable insight generated from their analysis. They must be experienced at presenting data and findings in an articulate actionable way to all levels of audience. This should be demonstrated at an interview and is often the differentiating feature between an analyst programmer and a Data Scientist. Thinking Like A Data Scientist: We will want to see that youíre a (data-driven) problem solver ñ for example, about a test the company may want to run or a data-driven product it may want to develop. Itís important to think about what things are important, and what things arenít. How should you, as the data scientist, interact with the Marketing teams, IT, and product managers? What methods should you use? When do approximations make sense?The Individual The exact background of a data scientist is very important. Typically the background is a Masterís Degree or even PhD in Mathematics, Statistics or Operational Research, coupled with several years of appropriate experience in data analytics. A Data Scientist should have most of the following skills: Strong written and verbal communication skillsAbility to work in a fast-paced multidisciplinary environment as in a competitive landscape new data keeps flowing in rapidly and the world is constantly changingHave the ability to query databases and perform statistical analysis;Be able to develop or program databasesBe able to advise senior management in clear language about the implications of their work for the organisationHave understanding of how business and strategy worksBeing able to create examples, prototypes, demonstrations to help management better understand the workHaving a good understanding of design and architecture principlesBeing able to work autonomously In short, the big data scientist needs to have an understanding of almost everything analytically coupled with commercial acumen.Additional informationThere will be project work to complete, which should be done in a professional manner.The duties listed are not exhaustive.
